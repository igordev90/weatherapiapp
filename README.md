This app is designed to provide you with accurate and up-to-date weather information for your location, as well as for any location you are interested in. It is built using the Android SDK and follows the principles of Material Design. The app uses the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern, with LiveData to enable a reactive user interface, and follows the Clean Architecture principles to create a robust and testable codebase.

The app utilizes the openweathermap.org API to retrieve weather data, which includes current weather conditions and weather forecasts. It uses Retrofit to make RESTful API calls, while HILT is used for dependency injection.
